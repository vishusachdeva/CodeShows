Mark has recently started studying string algorithms. So, as to gauge his knowledge, Lucy challenges him to a task.

"Given a string s, answer several times a query to determine whether a substring s[i, j] (inclusive) is palindromic
or not.", said Lucy in a confident tone!

As smart as Mark is, he was able to instantly find the solution!

Now, Mark has challenged little Lucy to do the same task by reversing a specific substring beforehand. As Lucy is still
just a novice, she asks for your help.

You have to write a program that answers Q queries on a string S.

Each query contains four integers (i, j, k, l). For every query, first reverse the substring s[i, j] (inclusive) and then
report if substring s[k, l] (inclusive) is a palindrome.

Note that the reversal operations are only for the specific query and should not persist for further queries. Please check
the explanation section for better understanding.

Input:
The first line of input file contains string S. The next line contains an integer Q.
Each of the following Q lines each contain 4 space separated integers i, j, k and l.

Output:
Output exactly Q lines, each containing the result of corresponding query as "Yes" or "No".

Constraints:
•	1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105
•	1 ≤ Q ≤ 333333
•	1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ |S|
•	1 ≤ k ≤ l ≤ |S|
•	S contains only the characters 'a' to 'z'

Example:
Sample Input:

ababa
4
2 3 3 4
1 2 3 4
1 3 3 5
2 4 1 5

Sample Output:

Yes
No
Yes
Yes
Explanation:
Query 1: The string becomes aabba. The queried substring is bb, which is a palindrome.

Query 2: The string becomes baaba. The queried substring is ab, which is not a palindrome.

Query 3: The string becomes ababa. The queried substring is aba, which is a palindrome.

Query 4: The string becomes ababa. The queried substring is ababa, which is a palindrome.

Notes:
Here, a substring [i, j] is defined as the string formed by characters s[i], s[i+1],..., s[j].
A palindrome is a sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. For example, aba, abba are palindromes,
while abab and abcd are not palindromes.
