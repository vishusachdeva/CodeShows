You are given a convex polygon of n vertices P1, P2, ..., Pn (in counter-clock or clock order). Each vertex is assigned with a weight wi.

Find a subset of vertices that includes vertex 1.

1 = i1 < i2 < ... < ik ≤ n that maximizes ratio:

(dist(i1, i2) + dist(i2, i3) + ... + dist(ik, i1)) / (wi1 + wi2 + ... + wik).

Where dist(i, j) refers to Euclidean distance between two points Pi, Pj.



Input
The first line contains an integer T denotes the number of test cases. Each test case is describes as follow:

An integer n on a single line.

n next lines, each line contains two integers, that is coordinates of i-th vertex

The last line contains n space-seperated integer, denotes weight of vertex.



Output
Each testcase output the maximum ratio can reach on a single line.

Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less then 10-6.



Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
3 ≤ n ≤ 105
The sum of n over all test cases is at most 2.105
0 ≤ all coordinates ≤ 109
1 ≤ wi ≤ 105
Subtask:

Subtask #1 (10 points): n ≤ 15
Subtask #2 (30 points): n ≤ 1000
Subtask #3 (60 points): original constrains
