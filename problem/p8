														Beautiful Arrays

An array a is called beautiful if for every pair of numbers ai, aj, (i ≠ j), there exists an ak
 such that ak = ai * aj. Note that k can be equal to i or j too.

Find out whether the given array a is beautiful or not!

Input
First line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow.

First line of each test case contains an integer n denoting number of elements in a.

Next line contains n space separated integers denoting the array a.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing "yes" or "no" (without quotes) corresponding to
 the answer of the problem.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 106
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
Sum of n over all the test cases ≤ 106
-109 ≤ ai ≤ 109
Example
Input
3
2
0 1
2
1 2
2
5 6

Output:
yes
yes
no
Explanation
Test case 1. If you multiply 0 with 1, you get 0, we see that a0 = 0. So, the array is beautiful.

Test case 3. If you multiply 5 with 6, you get 30, there does not exist an k such that ak = 30.
 So, the array is not beautiful.
