Chef is attending a chess competition. There are n people take part in. Each pair of people compete once.
Winner earns 1 point, loser earns 0 point. A game never ends with a draw. After all games are over, Organizer
decide to award prize to each participant. The prize of each participant is the square of his points. What is
all possible total money the organizer will pay for all participants? Given k, determine if there is at least
one scenario that the total money the organizers will pay is exactly k? If there's any, output one of them.



Input
First line contains an integer T denotes the number of test cases. The T following lines, each line contains
two integers n, k.



Output
For each test case, if there isn't a such scenario, output -1.

otherwise print n lines, each line contains n characters. j-th character in i-th line is "1" if i-th participant wins
j-th participant, otherwise "0". (i-th character in i-th line is always "0")



Constraints
•	1 ≤ T ≤ 100
•	1 ≤ n ≤ 103
•	The sum of n over all test cases is at most 104
•	1 ≤ k ≤ 109

Subtasks:

Subtask #1 (10 points): n ≤ 5
